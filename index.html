                        a deposit will be required. Not all services that people pre-register for are covered by the Ministry of

                    <p>
                    Your FAST WEB CHECK-IN pre-registration does not constitute the beginning of a clinic/physician and patient 
                    engagement and is not a guarantee of care. The patient engagement will be formalized at our reception window 
                    when registration is finalized.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    A FAST WEB CHECK-IN pre-registration places a potential patient into the waiting line. Once a patient presents 
                    their FAST WEB CHECK-IN pre-registration confirmation, the registration process will be completed at the 
                    reception window. The system will provide you with a time to attend the clinic. This is an estimation based on
                    current projected wait times. We can not predict, in advance, the number of patients who will register for 
                    care or the nature of the illness or injury that will require treatment. Therefore, you may still have a short
                    wait in our waiting room once you arrive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Your FAST WEB CHECK-IN pre-registration is valid only for the day you submit it. If you do not attend the 
                    clinic on that day, your registration will be cancelled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Some medical services or medical care is not provided or cannot be provided at our clinics. Patients may be 
                    referred to the hospital or specialists to receive care.
